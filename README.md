===  A25  =======================================

Create program both in C++, and Python. Program should output error message for incorrect input data. Program should allow repeated execution without quitting the program. During presentation, the following items should be demonstrated
  a) source code,
  b) test plan and results,
  c) executed program.
For details see Lab requirements.

A25. Print the first n members of the geometrical progression if given a(1) (first member) and q.

===  B10  =======================================

Create program both in C++, and Python by making use of described or other functions. Requirements are the same as for the previous task, see published detailed requirements.

B10. Given three natural numbers which denote date (day, month, year). Create function which returns weekday for that date. The solution should also contain an auxiliary function for leap year checking.

===  C7  =======================================

Create program in C++ by making use of described or other functions. Requirements are the same as for the previous task, see published detailed requirements.

C7. Given array (matrix) A(m,n) if integers (can also be negative). Find four numbers h,i,j,k which denote the sub-matrix with the maximum sum of its elements (h,i denote upper left corner, j,k - bottom right)

===  D14  =======================================

Create program in C++ in OOP structure, splitting it at least into 3 files. The class header should be put in header file (program.h). All the methods should be implemented outside the header â€“ in a special C++ file (program.cpp). Function main should be put in yet another C++ file (main.cpp). By default, all class fields are private, but class methods - public. Unlike previous programs, it is not required to follow specific interface rules regarding repeated execution here (function main can be hard-coded). See also other published requirements.

D14. Create class "Time" containing 3 numbers - hour, minute, second. Create methods: (1) constructor to set given initial values, (2) destructor which should notify about deleting the object, (3) method "change" with 3 parameters to set new values, (4) method "print" to print time on screen, (5) method "calculate" to print number of seconds from beginning of day and status - is it night or day time.
